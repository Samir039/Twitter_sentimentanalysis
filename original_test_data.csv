Today, I remembered how particularly sad it is that the details of Angelina Jolie's pregnancy, or Jennifer Aniston's latest living arrangement must be screamed out at hapless grocery shoppers the world over.
Angelina Jolie says that being self-destructive is selfish and you ought to think of the poor, starving, mutilated people all around the world.

Well, first thing to do before blogging about my trip to Shanghai is this dumb little meme:..
The history here goes back to the summer of 1992, when the San Francisco Giants were terrible.
Since then, 25 automakers including Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co. have recalled about 370,000 defective vehicles, according to the agency.
I both love and hate coming to these Harvard board meetings.

I loved the Lakers episode where he told that little blonde he wants to see a woman rule the world in his lifetime because women know how to look after the pack.
Finally, no post about the UCLA-Oregon game would be complete without a complaint about the shitty, shitty, Pac-10 officiating that went down today.

By the time I left the Hospital, I had no time to drive to Boston-which sucked because 1)

Another generation of Harvard students will be weaned into adulthood on a steady dose of feeling sexy ( even during the day ) and covering up the consequences of all that sexiness by whatever means necessary.
Ok, so the stupid American Airlines lost my luggage and I didn't get it back till this afternoon when most of the trip was over.

Personally, I blame Angelina Jolie, a psychologically-damaged attention-seeker who seems to have somehow convinced almost every woman on LJ that having an icon with her face on it makes you a sexually-interesting noncomformist wildchild.
